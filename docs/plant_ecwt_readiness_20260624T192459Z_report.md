## Summary

| Relation or Check | Rows / Value |
| --- | ---: |
| `readiness rows` | 16132 |
| `publication candidates` | 7837 |
| `provisional low coverage` | 8267 |
| `blocked` | 28 |
| `minimum coverage ratio` | 0.0000 |
| `median coverage ratio` | 0.2503 |

## By Reason

| Readiness | Reason | Rows |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `blocked` | `no_candidate_station_with_provisional_ecwt` | 28 |
| `provisional_low_coverage` | `coverage_ratio_below_threshold` | 6978 |
| `provisional_low_coverage` | `valid_hours_below_threshold` | 1289 |
| `publication_candidate` | `passes_current_publication_gate` | 7837 |

## Interpretation

- This is a working publication-readiness gate for provisional plant ECWT rows.
- Coverage ratios use a fixed selected-station active-period DJF denominator, not only currently loaded station-year files.
- `publication_candidate` is not the same as final accepted compliance output; it means the row passes the current coverage thresholds.
- Rows that fail this gate should stay out of a published compliance dataset until more weather coverage or manual review is available.
